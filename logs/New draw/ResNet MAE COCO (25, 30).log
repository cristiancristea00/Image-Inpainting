Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /tmp/matplotlib-dwk8ud22 because the default path (/home/cristec/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
